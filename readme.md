Dear All, Ive created 1 end-to-end test and few integration tests. 
Tools I used: Selenium Web Driver and Intellij IDEA.
Tests were working OK locally as far as I remember
Ideally, for testing the application few tools are recommended to be used: Selenium + Selenium Grid + Galen etc.
Grid/SauceLabs/Browserstack - to be used for cross-browsing testing 
Galen - to be used for layout testing
